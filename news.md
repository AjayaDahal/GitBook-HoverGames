## Recent updates

#### July 14, 2020

* The [development tools](developerguide/tools/) section in the developer guide has been updated. Because of changes in the [PX4 toolchain](developerguide/tools/toolchain-installation.md) and [MCUXpresso](developerguide/tools/mcuxpresso.md) some information and screenshots were outdated. 
* Note that the preconfigured [virtual machine image](downloads.md#preconfigured-virtual-machine-image-with-development-tools) has _not yet_ been updated, but it can still be used without any issue in its current state. However, it should now also be a little bit more straightforward to install your own VM from scratch!
