# Upgrades and add-on components

Here are some commonly used upgrades or add-on components for drones. They are not required for use with the HoverGames drone but you may enjoy adding them. The linked items are only suggestions, and should not be considered an endorsement of any specific company.

## Propellers

Original DJI propellers will be much better balanced than the propellers included with the kit, but quality comes at a price. The propellers below are very similar to the propellers that come with the HoverGames drone kit. You can also look for good quality propellers in any hobby flyer shop.
